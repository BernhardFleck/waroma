Sitting in the waiting room of a doctor's office or clinic is a shared experience across nearly
all human kind. Most people, regardless of where and how they live, have been in this
situation at least once in their life. For patients, hospital waiting rooms have a greater importance
than health professionals or hospital management might recognise.
Often, waiting rooms are the first contact point for patients when visiting a clinic and especially
outpatients spend the main part of their stay inside a waiting room. On the other
hand, waiting rooms play a major role for health professionals in managing patient flow,
acting as the main buffer in treatment routine. Outside the organizational importance, the
emotional component of waiting room attendance is of great importance from the patient’s
perspective. When being in need of medical help, anxiety and restlessness builds
up easily. Managing this emotional component again strains health professionals’ capacities
to keep up an effective workflow.

The purpose of this project is a digital waiting
room management system that can tackle
these challenges and improve the waiting
room experience for patients as well as improve
workflow from a management perspective.
